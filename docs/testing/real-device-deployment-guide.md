npm run ios -- --device "Hands Off my iPhone"
```

**Alternative Methods:**

```bash
# Let React Native auto-detect your device
npm run ios -- --device

# Using full device identifier
npm run ios -- --device 00008130-000A03583C98001C

# Using Xcode to build and deploy
cd ios && open ReactNativeTest.xcworkspace
# Then: Product > Destination > Hands Off my iPhone > Product > Run
```

## üì± **Device Status & Configuration**

### **Connected Devices**

Based on `xcrun xctrace list devices`:

**Physical Devices:**
- üì± **"Hands Off my iPhone (18.5)"** - `00008130-000A03583C98001C` ‚úÖ Ready
- üíª **Rogers-MacBook-Pro** - Development machine

**Simulators Available:**
- iPhone 16 Pro Simulator (18.5) - Currently booted
- iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Pro Max
- iPad Air, iPad Pro variants with M3/M4 chips

### **iOS Project Configuration**

Your Xcode project is properly configured:

```bash
Bundle Identifier: org.montessoricenter.reactnativetest
Team: The New School, Inc. (TLN4X39D5X)
Signing: Automatic (Recommended)
Target iOS Version: 13.0+
Development Target: iPhone and iPad
```

---

## üöÄ **Step-by-Step Device Deployment**

### **Step 1: Verify Device Connection**

```bash
# Check connected devices
xcrun xctrace list devices | grep "Hands Off my iPhone"

# Expected output:
# Hands Off my iPhone (18.5) (00008130-000A03583C98001C)
```

### **Step 2: Start Metro Bundler**

Open a new terminal and start the bundler:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Metro bundler
npm start

# Verify bundle endpoint is accessible
npm run test-bundle
# Should return: var __BUNDLE_START_TIME__=... (JavaScript code)
```

### **Step 3: Deploy to Device**

In another terminal:

```bash
# Terminal 2: Deploy to your iPhone
npm run ios -- --device "Hands Off my iPhone"
```

### **Step 4: App Installation & Launch**

The process will:

1. **Build the app** - Compile React Native code for iOS
2. **Sign the app** - Use your development certificate
3. **Install on device** - Transfer .app bundle to your iPhone
4. **Launch the app** - Open ReactNativeTest on your device
5. **Connect to Metro** - Enable hot reload for development

## üîß **Troubleshooting Real Device Issues**

### **Common Device Deployment Issues**

#### **Issue 1: "Unable to install app"**

```bash
# Solution: Clean build environment
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
cd ios && xcodebuild clean -workspace ReactNativeTest.xcworkspace -scheme ReactNativeTest
npm run clean
npm install
```

#### **Issue 2: "Development team not found"**

```bash
# Solution: Open in Xcode and configure signing
cd ios && open ReactNativeTest.xcworkspace
# Go to: Project > ReactNativeTest > Signing & Capabilities
# Select Team: "The New School, Inc."
# Ensure "Automatically manage signing" is checked
```

#### **Issue 3: "Device not found"**

```bash
# Solution: Check device connection and trust
# 1. Unplug and reconnect iPhone
# 2. On iPhone: Settings > General > VPN & Device Management
# 3. Trust your development certificate
# 4. Verify connection: xcrun xctrace list devices
```

#### **Issue 4: "Metro bundler connection failed"**

```bash
# Solution: Verify network and bundler
# 1. Check Metro is running: npm start
# 2. Check bundle endpoint: npm run test-bundle  
# 3. On iPhone: Settings > Developer > Clear Trusted Computers (if needed)
# 4. Restart both Metro and deployment
```

#### **Issue 5: "React Navigation dependency errors"**

If you see errors like `@react-navigation/core could not be found`:

```bash
# Solution: Fresh dependency install with cache reset
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
pkill -f "metro" || true
npx react-native start --reset-cache

# Verify bundle works:
npm run test-bundle
# Should return: var __BUNDLE_START_TIME__=... (JavaScript code)
```

#### **Issue 6: "Build succeeded but deployment failed (exit code 70)"**

```bash
# Solution: Use Xcode for manual deployment
open ios/ReactNativeTest.xcworkspace
# In Xcode:
# 1. Select your device from the destination dropdown
# 2. Click Product > Run (or press Cmd+R)
# 3. Xcode will handle signing and installation
```

### **Performance Optimization for Device Testing**

```bash
# Enable fast refresh and optimizations
npm run ios -- --device "Hands Off my iPhone" --configuration Debug

# For testing release builds on device
npm run ios -- --device "Hands Off my iPhone" --configuration Release
```
