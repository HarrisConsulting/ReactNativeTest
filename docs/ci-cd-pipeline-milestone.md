- **Updated Main Documentation** - `README.md` with CI/CD as next step
- **Repository Documentation** - Updated `git-repository-setup.md`

## 📊 Pipeline Capabilities

### Automated Quality Assurance

- **Code Linting** - ESLint with React Native configuration
- **TypeScript Checking** - Full type safety validation
- **Unit Testing** - Jest with coverage reporting (80% threshold)
- **Metro Bundle Testing** - JavaScript bundle validation

### Multi-Platform Builds

- **iOS Builds** - Xcode 15.0 with simulator testing
- **Android Builds** - Gradle with release APK generation
- **Parallel Execution** - Independent platform builds for speed
- **Build Artifacts** - Automatic archiving of build outputs

### Security and Compliance

- **Dependency Scanning** - npm audit for known vulnerabilities
- **Advanced Security** - Snyk integration for deep vulnerability analysis
- **Secret Protection** - Secure handling of deployment credentials
- **Compliance Reporting** - Automated security scan results

### Deployment Automation

- **iOS Deployment** - TestFlight automation with App Store Connect
- **Android Deployment** - Google Play Console internal testing
- **Release Triggers** - GitHub release-based deployment
- **Rollback Capability** - Previous version deployment support

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Workflow Triggers

```yaml
on:
    push:
        branches: [main, develop] # Full pipeline
    pull_request:
        branches: [main, develop] # Quality checks only
    release:
        types: [published] # Full pipeline + deployment
```

### Job Dependencies

1. **Parallel Quality Checks** - Lint, TypeScript, Unit Tests, Security Scan
2. **Platform Builds** - iOS and Android (depends on quality checks)
3. **Deployment** - TestFlight and Play Console (depends on builds + security)
4. **Notifications** - Slack alerts (depends on deployment)

### Performance Optimizations

- **Caching Strategy** - npm, CocoaPods, and Gradle caches
- **Parallel Execution** - Independent jobs run simultaneously
- **Build Artifacts** - Shared between jobs for efficiency
- **Conditional Deployment** - Only on releases to save resources

## 📱 Platform Configuration

### iOS Setup ✅

- **exportOptions.plist** - TestFlight deployment configuration
- **Code Signing** - Automatic signing with certificate management
