# Development Milestones

**Purpose**: Documentation of major achievement points and validation
checkpoints in React Native project development

## 📚 Milestone Documentation

### **Setup & Configuration Milestones:**

#### 📦 **Dependency Installation** → [`dependency-installation-milestone.md`](dependency-installation-milestone.md)

- **Package installation completion** and validation
- **Critical dependencies** for React Native and navigation
- **Installation verification** and troubleshooting steps

#### 🏗️ **First Build** → [`first-build-milestone.md`](first-build-milestone.md)

- **Initial app compilation** and build success
- **iOS simulator deployment** validation
- **Build process troubleshooting** and optimization

#### 📱 **iOS Setup** → [`ios-setup-milestone.md`](ios-setup-milestone.md)

- **iOS development environment** configuration
- **Bundle ID and team setup** completion
- **CocoaPods integration** and dependency management

#### ✅ **App Verification** → [`app-verification-milestone.md`](app-verification-milestone.md)

- **Complete app functionality** validation
- **Navigation system** testing and verification
- **UI/UX component** functionality confirmation

#### 🔗 **GitHub Repository** → [`github-repository-milestone.md`](github-repository-milestone.md)

- **Version control setup** and initial commit
- **Repository structure** and documentation
- **Collaboration readiness** and team access

## 🎯 **Milestone Validation Strategy**

### **Sequential Checkpoints**

Each milestone builds upon the previous one:

```
Dependencies → First Build → iOS Setup → App Verification → GitHub Setup
```

### **Validation Criteria**

Each milestone includes:

- ✅ **Success indicators** - What should work
- ✅ **Validation commands** - How to verify success
- ✅ **Troubleshooting** - What to do if issues occur
- ✅ **Next steps** - Preparation for subsequent milestones

### **Quality Gates**

Must pass before proceeding:

- **Zero critical errors** in current milestone
- **All validation commands** return expected results
- **Environment stability** confirmed for next phase

## 📊 **Milestone Benefits**

### **Risk Mitigation**

- **Early problem detection** before issues compound
- **Isolated troubleshooting** of specific development phases
- **Clear rollback points** if major issues occur

### **Team Coordination**

- **Shared understanding** of project progress
- **Clear handoff points** for team collaboration
- **Standardized validation** across team members

### **Documentation Value**

- **Historical record** of development progress
- **Reusable patterns** for future projects
- **Lessons learned** capture and preservation
