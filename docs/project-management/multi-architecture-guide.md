# Multi-Architecture Project Creation Guide

## 🎯 **Architecture Options in create-new-project-from-exemplar.sh**

The enhanced script now supports two distinct app architectures based on your needs:

### **🏗️ Architecture Selection**

When you run the script, you'll be prompted to choose:

```
1. 📱 Single Feature App (like ReactNativeTest)
2. 🏫 Multi-Feature Dashboard App (like school/business apps)
```

---

## 📱 **Option 1: Single Feature App**

**Best for**: Apps with one primary function or feature
**Examples**: Game apps, workout trackers, single-purpose tools

### **User Flow**:
```
HomeScreen → [Action Button] → Authentication → Main Feature Screen
```

### **Configuration**:
- **Main Screen Name**: Primary feature screen (e.g., `WorkoutScreen`, `GameScreen`)
- **Main Action Name**: Button text that triggers the main feature (e.g., "Start Workout")

### **Generated Structure**:
```
src/screens/
├── HomeScreen.tsx              # Landing page with main action
├── auth/                       # Authentication screens
│   ├── LoginScreen.tsx
│   ├── VerificationScreen.tsx
│   └── ProfileScreen.tsx
└── [content-type]/
    └── [MainScreen].tsx        # Your main feature screen
```

---

## 🏫 **Option 2: Multi-Feature Dashboard App**

**Best for**: Apps with multiple features accessed through a dashboard
**Examples**: School communication apps, business portals, multi-service platforms

### **User Flow**:
```
Authentication → Onboarding Screens → Dashboard → Individual Features
```

### **Configuration**:
- **Onboarding Screens**: Setup screens after authentication (default: Preferred Name, Email Settings, Classroom Selection)
- **Dashboard Features**: Feature buttons on main dashboard (default: Messages, Calendar, Announcements, Events, News, Directory)

### **Generated Structure**:
```
src/screens/
├── HomeScreen.tsx              # Landing page (minimal, leads to auth)
├── auth/                       # Authentication screens
│   ├── LoginScreen.tsx
│   ├── VerificationScreen.tsx
│   └── ProfileScreen.tsx
├── onboarding/                 # Post-auth setup screens
│   ├── PreferredNameScreen.tsx
│   ├── EmailSettingsScreen.tsx
│   └── ClassroomSelectionScreen.tsx
├── DashboardScreen.tsx         # Main feature navigation hub
└── features/                   # Individual feature screens
    ├── MessagesScreen.tsx
    ├── CalendarScreen.tsx
    ├── AnnouncementsScreen.tsx
    ├── EventsScreen.tsx
    ├── NewsScreen.tsx
    └── DirectoryScreen.tsx
```
