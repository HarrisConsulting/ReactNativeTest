# Understanding Script Configuration in create-new-project-from-exemplar.sh

## 🎯 **Enhanced Script with Architecture Options**

The script now supports **two distinct app architectures**:

### **📱 Single Feature Apps** 
- One main feature after authentication
- Examples: Game apps, workout trackers, single-purpose tools
- **Main Screen**: The primary feature screen users see after auth
- **Main Action**: Button text that navigates to the main feature

### **🏫 Multi-Feature Dashboard Apps**
- Multiple features accessible through a dashboard
- Examples: School communication apps, business portals, multi-service platforms  
- **Onboarding Screens**: Setup screens after authentication
- **Dashboard Features**: Feature buttons on the main dashboard

---

## 🎓 **For NewSchoolConnect (Multi-Feature Dashboard)**

### **Recommended Configuration**:
```bash
🏷️  Project Name: NewSchoolConnect
📱 Content Type: education  
📝 Project Description: Parent-school communication app
🔧 Architecture: 2 (Multi-Feature Dashboard)

🎨 Onboarding Screens: PreferredNameScreen,EmailSettingsScreen,ClassroomSelectionScreen
🔧 Dashboard Features: Messages,Calendar,Announcements,Events,News,Directory
```

### **Generated User Flow**:
```
Authentication → Onboarding (3 screens) → Dashboard → Feature Screens
```

### **What Gets Created**:
- ✅ **Authentication**: Email OTP verification (existing ReactNativeTest system)
- ✅ **Onboarding**: 3 customizable setup screens
- ✅ **Dashboard**: Main screen with feature navigation buttons (like your screenshot)
- ✅ **Feature Screens**: Individual screens for Messages, Calendar, etc.
- ✅ **Navigation**: Complete routing between all screens

## 🔧 **Script Improvements Made**

### **1. Architecture Selection**
```bash
Choose your app's architecture pattern:

1. 📱 Single Feature App (like ReactNativeTest)
2. 🏫 Multi-Feature Dashboard App (like school/business apps)
```

### **2. Multi-Feature Configuration** 
- **Onboarding Screens**: Comma-separated list of setup screens
- **Dashboard Features**: Comma-separated list of main features
- **Smart Defaults**: Pre-configured for school apps if you press Enter

### **3. Generated Structure for Multi-Feature**:
```
src/screens/
├── onboarding/           # Post-auth setup screens
├── DashboardScreen.tsx   # Main feature navigation hub  
└── features/             # Individual feature screens
```

### **4. Validation and Editing**
- Input validation for screen names
- Preview of user flow before creation
- Edit capability to modify configuration

---

## ✅ **Perfect for Your NewSchoolConnect App**

The **Multi-Feature Dashboard** architecture is exactly what you need:

1. **Authentication**: Email OTP (already proven in ReactNativeTest)
2. **Onboarding**: 3 screens for setup (preferred name, email options, classroom selection)
3. **Dashboard**: Multiple feature buttons (matching your screenshot layout)
4. **Features**: Individual screens for each school function

The script creates a production-ready foundation that you can customize for your specific school communication needs! 🚀
