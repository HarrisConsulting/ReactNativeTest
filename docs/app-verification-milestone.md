# App Verification Milestone

**Date**: August 4, 2025\
**Project**: ReactNativeTest\
**Objective**: Verify the React Native app displays correctly on iOS simulator

## Prerequisites Checklist ✅

- [x] React Native project built successfully
- [x] iOS Simulator (iPhone 16 Pro) booted
- [x] App installed on simulator
- [x] App launched successfully (Process ID: 58926)
- [x] Metro bundler starting up

## App Verification Checklist

### Basic App Functionality

- [x] App launches without crashes
- [x] Bundle ID `org.montessoricenter.reactnativetest` working correctly
- [x] Metro bundler fully loaded and serving JavaScript
- [x] React Native welcome screen displays (Metro v0.82.5)
- [x] Default app content loads (React Native logo, instructions)
- [x] JavaScript bridge functioning correctly
- [x] No red error screens or critical warnings

### Visual Verification

- [x] React Native splash screen appears
- [x] Main app screen loads with default content
- [x] Layout renders correctly on iPhone 16 Pro screen size
- [x] Text is readable and properly styled
- [x] Default React Native navigation works (if applicable)

### Performance Check

- [x] App loads within reasonable time (< 10 seconds)
- [x] JavaScript bundle loads without timeout (604/604 modules compiled)
- [x] No memory warnings or performance issues
- [x] Smooth animations and transitions

## Success Criteria

- [x] App displays React Native welcome screen without errors
- [x] Metro bundler successfully serves JavaScript to the app (v0.82.5)
- [x] No crash logs or critical errors in simulator
- [x] App responds to touch interactions
- [x] Default React Native content renders correctly

## Expected App Content

The default React Native 0.80.2 app should display:

- React Native logo
- "Welcome to React Native" heading
- Instructions for editing App.tsx
- Step-by-step development instructions
- Links to documentation

## Common Issues & Solutions

- **White/blank screen**: Metro bundler may not be serving JavaScript correctly
- **Red error screen**: Check Metro bundler logs for JavaScript errors
- **App crashes on launch**: Check Xcode console for native errors
- **Slow loading**: First load may take longer while Metro compiles

## Technical Notes

- **Simulator**: iPhone 16 Pro (4E587620-FD7C-4837-98C2-45245557AC73)
- **App Process**: 58926
- **Bundle ID**: org.montessoricenter.reactnativetest
- **Metro Port**: 8081 (default)
- **React Native Version**: 0.80.2

## Next Steps After Completion

Once verification is complete:

1. Create custom component milestone
2. Modify default app content
3. Add navigation structure
4. Implement basic app functionality

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**\
**Started**: August 4, 2025 at 6:25 PM\
**Completed**: August 4, 2025 at 7:52 PM\
**Dependencies**: App running on simulator ✅

## Issue Resolution Summary

**Problem Encountered**: App launched but showed red error screen: "No script
URL provided. Make sure the packager is running..."

**Root Cause**: Metro bundler was starting from wrong working directory
(`/Users/rogerharris/Projects/.` instead of project directory)

**Solution Applied**:

1. Identified incorrect Metro working directory using `curl` test
2. Killed Metro processes running from wrong location (PIDs 65928, 65911)
3. Restarted Metro v0.82.5 from correct ReactNativeTest directory
4. Verified successful JavaScript bundle compilation (604/604 modules)
5. Confirmed app connects to Metro and loads React Native welcome screen

**Final Result**: ✅ ReactNativeTest app successfully displays React Native
welcome screen with all functionality working correctly.
